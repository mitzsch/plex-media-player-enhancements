# plex-media-player-enhancements
Enhancements to the "Next generation Plex Desktop/Embedded Client"

## Enhancements
* ``Switched to vo=libmpv``
* ``Prevent PMP switch to 100hz  - when playing back 25 or 50 fps movies``
* ``Updated mpv commands to remove some mpv deprecated flags``
* ``Added more stats to the video overlay``
* ``Added audio delay setting for 30Hz``
* ``Enable gpu for the gui``


## Building on Linux

Plex Media Player officially requires Qt 5.9.5. Our users have indicated that Qt 5.10 and Qt 5.11 also builds correctly. However, Qt 5.11.0 and 5.11.1 versions are _incompatible_ and should be avoided. Qt 5.12 may work for you. Please consider building PMP within a dedicated VM or Docker container if your system has a Qt version installed newer than 5.9.5. Downgrading a system Qt will cause issues in other applications depending on a newer Qt version.

These instructions are for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and up. They were tested on a fresh install without extra options and with auto-updates applied.

First, some preparations:

* ``sudo apt install autoconf automake libtool libharfbuzz-dev libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev
    libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libvdpau-dev libva-dev mesa-common-dev libegl1-mesa-dev
    yasm libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libuchardet-dev zlib1g-dev libfribidi-dev git
    libgnutls28-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libsdl2-dev cmake``
* ``mkdir pmp``
* ``cd pmp``

Systems not based on Debian/Ubuntu will have similar packages, but you'll need to figure out their names yourself.

## Downloading and installing Qt

Download the Qt installer from qt.io and install a supported Qt version.

On Windows and OSX, you can omit the ``-DQTROOT`` argument to use the Qt built by Plex. (Untested whether this works reliably.)

## Building mpv and ffmpeg

While most distros have FFmpeg and mpv packages, they're often outdated. It's recommended to build a current version, or to get them from 3rd party sources (some are listed on https://mpv.io/installation/).

Here are instructions how to build them locally. First you need to install some build prerequisites:

* ``git clone https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build.git``
* ``cd mpv-build``
* ``echo --enable-libmpv-shared > mpv_options``
* you can also add ``echo --disable-cplayer >> mpv_options`` to prevent mpv CLI from being built
* ``./rebuild -j4`` (this steps checks out all sources and compiles them and takes a while)
* ``sudo ./install``
* ``sudo ldconfig``

With this, libmpv should have been installed to ``/usr/local/``. It does not conflict with the system. In particular, it does not install or use FFmpeg libraries. (The FFmpeg libraries are statically linked in libmpv when using mpv-build.)

You can also attempt to skip the installation step, and change the paths in the PMP build step to the build directory, but this is more complicated.

## Building plex-media-player

Assuming that everything else has installed correctly, building Plex Media Player should now be fairly straightforward:

* ``cd ~/pmp/``
* ``git clone git://github.com/plexinc/plex-media-player``
* ``cd plex-media-player``
* ``mkdir build``
* ``cd build``
* ``cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DQTROOT=/opt/Qt5.9.5/5.9/gcc_64/ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/ ..``
* ``make -j4``
* ``sudo make install``

You should now be able to start PMP as ``plexmediaplayer`` from the terminal.


Normally, the Ninja generator (via ``-GNinja``) is preferred, but cmake + ninja support appears to be broken on Ubuntu 16.04.

If you want, you can wipe the ``~/pmp/`` directory, as the PMP installation does not depend on it. Only Qt and libmpv are needed.

Sometimes, PMP's cmake run mysteriously fails. It's possible that https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-54666 is causing this. Try the following:

* locate ``Qt5CoreConfigExtras.cmake`` of your Qt build/installation
* comment ``set_property(TARGET Qt5::Core PROPERTY INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES cxx_decltype)`` with ``#``

Sometimes, PMP will pick up SDL 1.x libraries. This is not supported and will lead to build failures. You need SDL 2. You can disable use of SLD with ``-DENABLE_SDL2=off`` (it's used for some remotes).

## Advices 

* If you like to run PlexMediaPlayer on a 4K TV you should use Qt 5.12.X instead of Qt 5.9.5 or Qt 5.11.3. This prevents UI glitches and especially glitches in the settings menu.

* Disable the PMPHelper as it has no function under Linux and causes some issues when shutting down the system (A process for ... is running)  -> Add ``-DENABLE_HELPER=off`` to the ``cmake`` line

* If you need interlacing donÂ´t use the newer mpv versions because they fundamentally changed the way how interlaced content is handled. (< v0.27)


## FAQ
* _VAAPI on Linux is not working?_

Run ``QT_XCB_GL_INTEGRATION=xcb_egl plexmediaplayer``


* _HDR passthrough support?_

Might come in the future, when the Linux Kernel and mpv support HDR passthrough on X11, PlexMediaPlayer will probably support it aswell
